This [website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) has great information about css code.\n\nAs an example if you wanted to change the color of the blue line to green you could change where it says `lightblue` to `lightgreen` in the `styles.css` file. You can also use a hex color code like those that can be found at this [website](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/), such as `#00FF9E` to get a specific shade. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](resources/images/blue.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Change color of line' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you change the css file with a new element that is not already defined like `body` then you would need to do it as done with the `banner` element. This was then added to the index.Rmd file by using:\n\n```\n<div class = \"banner\">\nBanner text!  \n</div>\n```\n\nAlso checkout the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#workflow) for more customization of the pages.\n\n",
