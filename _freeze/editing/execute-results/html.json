Note that **not all icons will work** because they are not all set up with the packages that make rendering the website possible, so this may require some trial and error.  Here is an example of how you would use all of these icon options to add more:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](resources/images/more_icons.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='more icon options' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would result in a navigation bar with these icons:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](resources/images/more_icons_result.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='more icon options' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n",
