Keep this personal access token handy for the next step. When you get to the permissions page, check the box that says repo and select all that is underneath that header. No other permissions are necessary.\n\n\n\nClick here for more detailed instructions. The instructions for this step may change with updates to GitHub.\n\nFirst, go to your username settings, by clicking on your user icon (upper right corner) and scrolling down to settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, scroll all the way down on the far right menu to “Developer Settings”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen select “Personal Access Tokens” and “Tokens (classic)”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click “Generate new token” and confirm that you want classic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, add a name select all the repo scopes and scroll down to the green button to generate the token. Copy this somewhere safe to then paste into your repository settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your new OTTR_Template_Website derived repository, go to Settings &gt; Secrets and variables &gt; Actions.
