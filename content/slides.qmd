## Background and Motivation

Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have become essential 
tools in biomedical research, enabling large-scale analyses across diverse 
domains such as genomics, structural biology, and electronic health 
records-based research. Increasingly, researchers rely on model-generated 
predictions, rather than directly measured variables, as inputs for downstream 
statistical analyses. For example, predicted gene expression values or 
polygenic risk scores are often used in place of experimental assays, allowing 
researchers to expand cohort sizes and explore hypotheses when traditional data 
collection is infeasible, costly, or time-consuming.

While this practice of "using predictions as data" holds promise for 
accelerating scientific discovery, it presents significant challenges for 
statistical inference. When predicted values are used in place of true 
variables, the resulting estimates of association can be biased and misleading 
if uncertainty in the prediction step is not properly accounted for.

## Key Takeaway

Modern biomedical analyses increasingly rely on machine learning predictions
as inputs to downstream statistical models. This can expand scope and improve
feasibility, but treating predictions as if they were observed data can bias
effect estimates and understate uncertainty.
