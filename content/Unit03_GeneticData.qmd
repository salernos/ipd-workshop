## Background & Motivation

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, 
but it exhibits marked genetic heterogeneity, with distinct chromosomal 
translocations defining molecular subtypes with divergent prognoses and 
therapeutic responses. In B-cell lineage ALL, the **BCR-ABL1** fusion 
("breakpoint cluster region"/"Abelson", i.e., the "Philadelphia chromosome") 
arises from a t(9;22) translocation and encodes a constitutively active 
tyrosine kinase. This fusion was historically associated with poor outcomes, 
until the advent of targeted therapies (e.g., imatinib) revolutionized 
treatment and survival.

<br/>

<br/>

High-density microarray profiling measures expression of over 7,000 genes 
in leukemic blast cells, enabling a form of "molecular diagnostics" where 
supervised learning can:

1. **Classify** fusion status or other genetic subtypes when cytogenetic assays (PCR, FISH) are unavailable.
2. **Discover** novel marker genes and pathways dysregulated by specific fusions.
3. **Predict** therapeutic response and stratify risk using expression-derived scores.

However, in many retrospective or multi-center cohorts, only a subset of 
patients undergo gold-standard fusion testing (e.g., RT-PCR for BCR-ABL1), 
leaving the majority "unlabeled." A common workaround is to train a gene
expression classifier on the small labeled subset and apply it to the larger 
unlabeled cohort. Yet, naive downstream analyses, treating predicted labels 
as ground truth, can yield biased effect estimates and understate uncertainty.

[**Inference with Predicted Data (IPD)**](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/41/2/btaf055/7997267) 
offers a principled remedy: it combines a small labeled set with the predicted 
labels (e.g., with true fusion status) with a larger unlabeled set, adjusting 
both bias and variance. In this module, we will:

1. **Describe** the [`ALL`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/ALL.html) and [`Golub`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/manuals/golubEsets/man/golubEsets.pdf) Bioconductor datasets.
2. **Subset** the `ALL` data to B-cell ALL and filter to the top 500 variable probes.
3. **Harmonize** probes across platforms via gene symbols.
4. **Split** the `ALL` data and train three classifiers for BCR-ABL1 fusion status.
5. **Predict** on the holdout `ALL` and `Golub` B-cell ALL data using the `ALL`-trained classifier.
6. **Apply** IPD to estimate the association between fusion status and patient sex assigned at birth.

By the end, you will understand how to leverage expression-based predictions 
while maintaining valid inference on genetic subtypes in cohorts with partially 
missing gold-standard labels.

## Datasets Overview

We work with two public [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) datasets:

* [**ALL**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/ALL.html) (`ALL` package): 128 samples of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (both B- and T-cell), profiled on the Affymetrix HGU95Av2 microarray. Phenotype data include `BT` (immunophenotype), `mol.biol` (molecular subtype including BCR-ABL1 or NEG), age, and sex.
* [**Golub_Merge**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/manuals/golubEsets/man/golubEsets.pdf) (`golubEsets` package): 72 samples of leukemias (ALL vs. AML), profiled on Affymetrix HGU6800. Phenotype data include `ALL.AML`, `T.B.cell` (lineage), age, and sex.

We will train our classifiers on a subset of the `ALL` data, test the model on 
the holdout `ALL` data, and perform IPD on the holdout `ALL` and `Golub` data.

## Phenotype Reduction and Feature Filtering

We first narrow to B-cell ALL samples and reduce dimensionality by keeping the 500 most variable probes.

```{r}
# Load the ALL data
data(ALL)

# Subset ALL to B-cell lineage (BT codes starting with "B")
bALL <- ALL[, substr(pData(ALL)$BT, 1, 1) == "B"]

# Keep only fusion-negative ("NEG") and fusion-positive ("BCR/ABL") samples
fus <- bALL[, bALL$mol.biol %in% c("NEG", "BCR/ABL")]

# Convert to factor with clear levels: NEG=0, BCR/ABL=1
fus$mol.biol <- factor(fus$mol.biol, levels = c("NEG", "BCR/ABL"))

# Compute median absolute deviation (MAD) for each probe
devs <- apply(exprs(fus), 1, mad)

# Select top 500 most variable probes by MAD ranking
top500 <- order(devs, decreasing = TRUE)[1:500]

# Subset ExpressionSet to top 500 probes
dat_filt <- fus[top500, ]

# Confirm dimensions: 500 probes x n samples
dim(exprs(dat_filt))
```

> **Explanation:**
>
> * `mad()` is robust to outliers and captures variability.
> * Filtering saves time on downstream analysis without losing key signals.
> * We now have `dat_filt`, a filtered ALL dataset focused on B-cell lineage and the most informative probes.

## Cross-Platform Probe Harmonization

To predict on the `Golub` data, which uses a different array, we map probes 
from each platform to gene symbols, then intersect to find a common gene set.

```{r}
# Load the Golub data
data(Golub_Merge)

# Map HGU95Av2 probes (ALL) to gene symbols
gmap_all <- AnnotationDbi::select(
  hgu95av2.db,
  keys    = featureNames(dat_filt),
  columns = c("PROBEID","SYMBOL"),
  keytype = "PROBEID"
)

# HGU6800 probes (Golub) to gene symbols
gmap_golub <- AnnotationDbi::select(
  hu6800.db,
  keys    = featureNames(Golub_Merge),
  columns = c("PROBEID","SYMBOL"),
  keytype = "PROBEID"
)

# Identify common symbols
common_sym <- intersect(gmap_all$SYMBOL, gmap_golub$SYMBOL)

# For each symbol, pick the first associated probe
probe_all <- gmap_all |> 
  filter(SYMBOL %in% common_sym) |> 
  group_by(SYMBOL) |> 
  dplyr::slice(1) |> 
  drop_na()

probe_golub <- gmap_golub |> 
  filter(SYMBOL %in% common_sym) |> 
  group_by(SYMBOL) |> 
  dplyr::slice(1) |> 
  drop_na()

# Subset ExpressionSets to these probes
dat_train  <- dat_filt[probe_all$PROBEID, ]
eset_golub <- Golub_Merge[probe_golub$PROBEID, ]

# Further subset Golub to B-cell ALL samples
golub_bALL <- eset_golub[, pData(eset_golub)$T.B.cell == "B-cell" &
                           pData(eset_golub)$ALL.AML  == "ALL"]

featureNames(dat_train) <- probe_all$SYMBOL
rownames(exprs(dat_train)) <- probe_all$SYMBOL

featureNames(golub_bALL) <- probe_golub$SYMBOL
rownames(exprs(golub_bALL)) <- probe_golub$SYMBOL


# Confirm feature dimensions
dim(dat_train)    # features x ALL samples
dim(golub_bALL)   # features x Golub B-cell ALL samples
```

> `dat_train` and `golub_BALL` now share the same gene-symbol feature set, ready for model training and transfer.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

With our filtered training set (`dat_train`), we explore patterns using a 
heatmap and principal component analysis (PCA).

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, out.width="100%", dpi=300}
# Set subtype colors for visualization
fcol <- ifelse(dat_train$mol.biol == "NEG", "gray", "steelblue")

heatmap(exprs(dat_train), ColSideColors = fcol)
```

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, out.width="100%", dpi=300}
# PCA on samples
PCg <- prcomp(t(exprs(dat_train)))

# Scree plot
plot(PCg)
```

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, out.width="100%", dpi=300}
# Scatterplots of PCs
pairs(PCg$x[, 1:5], col = fcol, pch = 19)
```

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, out.width="100%", dpi=300}
# Biplot of PC1 vs PC2
biplot(PCg) 
```

> **Interpretation:**
>
> * The heatmap reveals distinct blocks of probes whose expression differs between BCR-ABL1 fusion-positive and fusion-negative samples.
> * The PCA scatter shows separation (or overlap) of samples by fusion status along the first two principal components, and to a lesser extent, the next three.
> * In the biplot, probes lying far from the origin along PC1 or PC2 represent genes with the largest loadings, i.e., the greatest contribution to those principal components. Samples positioned similarly share expression patterns in those genes.
> * Overall, the modest separation in PCA indicates the need for supervised methods to pinpoint the genes most predictive of BCR-ABL1 status.

## Train/Test Split and Classifier Training

We split `dat_train` (ALL) into 60% training and 40% holdout, then train three ML models.

```{r}
set.seed(2025)                # for reproducibility
n_all <- ncol(dat_train)      # number of ALL samples
train_idx <- sample(n_all, size = floor(0.6 * n_all))
# Training and holdout ExpressionSets
train_eset <- dat_train[, train_idx]
test_eset  <- dat_train[, -train_idx]
```

In this section, we compare three supervised learning methods using the 
[`MLInterfaces`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/MLInterfaces/inst/doc/MLprac2_2.html) 
framework:

* **Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis (dldaI)**
* **Neural Network (nnetI)**
* **Random Forest (randomForestI)**

We will use the `MLearn()` function, which wraps each algorithm, providing a 
consistent interface to train, predict, and evaluate models on an 
`ExpressionSet`. After fitting, we will use `confuMat()` to display the 
confusion matrix, showing the true versus predicted class counts.

We train each model on the first 40 most variable probes from the filtered 
`ExpressionSet` (features `1:40` in `train_eset`).

### Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis (`dldaI`)

Diagonal LDA assumes each feature is conditionally independent (covariance 
matrix is diagonal), which can improve stability in high-dimensional, 
low-sample settings. We use the `dldaI` interface to fit and evaluate this 
classifier.

```{r}
# Train Diagonal LDA on probes 1:40
dlda_mod <- MLearn(
  mol.biol ~ ., # mol.biol ~ . specifies BCR/ABL1 fusion status as the outcome
  train_eset,   # Filtered ExpressionSet
  dldaI,        # dldaI is the diagonal LDA interface
  1:40          # 1:40 selects the first 40 probes
)

# Print a summary of the fitted model
dlda_mod

# Display the confusion matrix (true vs predicted)
cm_dlda <- confuMat(dlda_mod)
cm_dlda

# Accuracy of Diagonal LDA
acc_dlda <- sum(diag(cm_dlda)) / sum(cm_dlda)
cat("Accuracy:", sprintf("%.2f%%", acc_dlda * 100))
```

### Neural Network (`nnetI`)

A single hidden layer neural network can capture non-linear relationships. We 
use the `nnetI` interface with default parameters plus:

* `size = 5`: number of hidden neurons

* `decay = 0.01`: weight-decay regularization

* `MaxNWts = 2000`: maximum allowed number of weights

```{r}
# Neural Network (nnetI)
nn_mod <- MLearn(
  mol.biol ~ ., 
  train_eset, 
  nnetI, 
  1:40, 
  size=5, 
  decay=0.01, 
  MaxNWts=2000
)

# Show model summary
nn_mod

# Confusion matrix for Neural Net
cm_nn <- confuMat(nn_mod)
cm_nn

# Accuracy of Neural Net
acc_nn <- sum(diag(cm_nn)) / sum(cm_nn)
cat("Accuracy:", sprintf("%.2f%%", acc_nn * 100))
```

### Random Forest (`randomForestI`)

Random forests build an ensemble of decision trees on bootstrapped samples and 
random feature subsets, offering robust performance with little tuning. We use 
the `randomForestI` to fit a random forest model: 

```{r}
# Random Forest (randomForestI)
rf_mod <- MLearn(
  mol.biol ~ ., 
  train_eset, 
  randomForestI, 
  1:40
)

# Show model summary
rf_mod

# Confusion matrix
cm_rf <- confuMat(rf_mod)
cm_rf

# Accuracy of Random Forest
acc_rf <- sum(diag(cm_rf)) / sum(cm_rf)
cat("Accuracy:", sprintf("%.2f%%", acc_rf * 100))
```

> **Interpretation:**
> Only the Random Forest achieves perfect separation in the validation samples. This highlights the challenge of discriminating BCR-ABL1 status based solely on the top variable probes and underscores why downstream IPD corrections (for regression inference) remain valuable.

## Predictions on ALL Test and Golub

After fitting our classifiers on the **training** subset of ALL, we now generate predictions on both the **ALL holdout test** and the **Golub B-cell ALL** datasets.

```{r}
# Predict BCR-ABL1 status on ALL test holdout using random forest
all_pred <- MLInterfaces::predict.classifierOutput(rf_mod, test_eset)

# Compare to true labels in test_eset
conf_mat_test <- table(
  Truth    = test_eset$mol.biol,
  Predicted= all_pred$testPredictions
)
conf_mat_test
```

```{r}
# Predict BCR-ABL1 status on Golub B-cell ALL
golub_pred <- MLInterfaces::predict.classifierOutput(rf_mod, golub_bALL)

# Summarize prediction counts (no ground truth in Golub)
table(golub_pred$testPredictions)
```

> **Note:** We retain **true** labels in the ALL test set for later IPD; Golub remains **unlabeled**.

## IPD Inference on Sex Effect

We will now use **Inference with Predicted Data (IPD)** to estimate the log-odds effect of **sex** (male vs female) on true BCR-ABL1 status, combining the holdout ALL data with true and predict fusion status (i.e., our labeled data) and the Golub data with the predicted fusion status (i.e., our unlabeled data)

```{r}
# Build labeled (ALL test) data frame
df_test <- tibble(
  sample = colnames(test_eset),
  set    = "labeled",
  true   = as.integer(test_eset$mol.biol == "BCR/ABL"),
  pred   = as.integer(all_pred$testPredictions == "BCR/ABL"),
  sex    = factor(pData(test_eset)$sex, levels = c("F","M"))
)

# Build unlabeled (Golub) data frame
df_golub <- tibble(
  sample = colnames(golub_bALL),
  set    = "unlabeled",
  true   = NA_real_,
  pred   = as.integer(golub_pred$testPredictions == "BCR/ABL"),
  sex    = factor(pData(golub_bALL)$Gender, levels = c("F","M"))
)

# Combine for IPD
ipd_df <- bind_rows(df_test, df_golub) |> drop_na(sex)
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, out.width="100%", dpi=300}
# Classical regression
class_fit <- glm(true ~ sex, "binomial", df_test)
class_df  <- broom::tidy(class_fit) |>
  mutate(method = "Classical")

# Naive regression
naive_fit <- glm(pred ~ sex, "binomial", df_golub)
naive_df  <- broom::tidy(naive_fit) |>
  mutate(method = "Naive")

# IPD logistic regression
ipd_fit <- ipd(
  formula   = true - pred ~ sex,
  method    = "pspa",
  model     = "logistic",
  data      = ipd_df,
  label     = "set",
)
ipd_df  <- tidy(ipd_fit) |>
  mutate(method = "IPD")

# Summarize coefficients
combined <- bind_rows(class_df, naive_df, ipd_df) |>
  mutate(term = recode(term, "sexM" = "Male (vs Female)"))

# Forest plot
ggplot(combined, aes(x = estimate, y = term, color = method)) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = 0.6)) +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = estimate - 1.96 * std.error,
                     xmax = estimate + 1.96 * std.error),
                 height = 0.2,
                 position = position_dodge(width = 0.6)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +
  scale_fill_manual(values  = c("#1B365D", "#00C1D5", "#AA4AC4")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#1B365D", "#00C1D5", "#AA4AC4")) +
  labs(
    x = "Log-Odds Estimate (95% CI)",
    y = "Covariate",
    title = "Comparison of BCR-ABL1 Model Coefficients",
    color = "Model Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

> **Insight:** By treating the ALL test set as labeled and Golub as unlabeled, IPD  combines information across cohorts to correct bias and improve precision when estimating the association between BCR-ABL1 status and patient sex.
